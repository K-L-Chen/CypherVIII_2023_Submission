## 2023 IDEAS
New things to add:
1. Add graphics, we can't have everything be just in the command line.
2. Add some new Battle gameplay features (Possibilities below)
3. New dialouge and changed story
4. Possibly Story events, which would be new scenes with their own graphics. (Maybe add a bit of randomness between battles)
5. Possibly add sounds (MIDI or just wav or mp3)

New gameplay ideas:
1. Add classes that change your two additional moves. (Old game had heal and crit as default specical moves) (Normal Attack is default action)
2. Add items (including default items for classes) that can be gotten through gameplay. (Functionally a swappable special move)
