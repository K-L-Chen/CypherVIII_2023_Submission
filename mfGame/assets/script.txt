Last year you achieved  
victory against Res Life, 
and gained access to
an On-Campus dorm room. 
The rest of your year
went normally until it came 
time to apply for a
Housing contract for next year…
Res Life: Yeah, we are 
demolishing like all the buildings
Impossible! you think.
How will they ever have enough 
room for all the students if 
they close down multiple dorms?
Residence Life: Oh, We won’t.
Which means…
IT’S TIME FOR A HOUSING ROYALE!
