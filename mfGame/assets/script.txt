Last year you achieved  
victory against Res Life, 
and gained access to
an On-Campus dorm room. 
The rest of your year
went normally until it came 
time to apply for a
Housing contract for next year�
Res Life: Yeah, we are 
demolishing like all the buildings
Impossible! you think.
How will they ever have enough 
room for all the students if 
they close down multiple dorms?
Residence Life: Oh, We won�t.
Which means�
IT�S TIME FOR A HOUSING ROYALE!
2
choice 

Entrance to the Wren Building:

Once again, you must make your way
to Resident’s Life and get a room
for next year. 

Res Life can only be found on
the top floor of the Wren building,
but be warned. 

Only a select few can live in the
limited number of dorms on campus,
and there will be those who
will try to stop you.
It is a Housing Royale (2) after all.

As you make your way to the
Wren building, it is quiet.
Too quiet.

As you enter through the massive double
doors of the ancient building,
you see nothing but dust
and the stairs leading to your goal.
However, right as you start to
make your way up the stairs,
the doors slam shut behind you.

No turning back now.

Floor 1:

As you make it to the top of the Stairs,
there is someone waiting for you.
Waitlisted Student:
Only I will have an On-Campus Dorm!!!
You:
Wai..
Waitlisted Student:
HAVE AT YOU!
Waitlisted Student Attacks!

battle

The Waitlisted Student collapses onto the floor.

He must be very sleepy after that fight.

You leave your former adversary to his nap
and continue to the next floor.
Floor 2:

As you get to the top of the stairs,
you are once again ambushed by two students.
Waitlisted Student #1:
The room will be ours!
Waitlisted Student #2:
We are in a roommate group!
You:But I thought roommate groups
were disbanded when you get on the waitlist?
Waitlisted Student #1:
…
Waitlisted Student #2:
…
Waitlisted Student #1 and
Waitlisted Student #2 Attack!
battle

Waitlisted Student #1 and #2:
You’ll regret this!
You’ll rue the day you
crossed our roommate group!
Waitlisted Student #1 and #2 both
jump out of an open window.
They'll probably be fine.

You continue up to the final floor of the
Wren building where Res life is waiting.
Floor 3:

You approach the door to Residence Life,

the final confrontation. 

However, before you can open the door
you hear a voice from behind you. 
“Hey Former Roomie.”

It’s your former roommate!

You:
So you’ve come to stop me, and get your own stop instead!
Former Roommate:
No, I already have an apartment at Midtown.
You:
Then why are you here?
Former Roommate:
I came here just to laugh at you. 
Former Roommate:
HAHAHAHAHA!
